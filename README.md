# Project Title

News Exchange System

## Project Description

The News Exchange System is a client-server application that allows users to retrieve news updates from NewsAPI.org. The system consists of two main components: a server script responsible for fetching news data and responding to client requests, and a client script that enables users to interact with the server and retrieve news information.

## Requirements

To set up and run the project in a local environment, follow these steps:

1. Install Python if not already installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-exchange-system.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd news-exchange-system`
4. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Obtain a NewsAPI API key from https://newsapi.org/ and replace `"YOUR_NEWSAPI_API_KEY"` in the server script with your actual API key.

## How to Run

To run the system:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Start the server by running `python CreateServer.py`.
4. In another terminal or command prompt, start the client by running `python Client.py`.
5. Follow the instructions on the client-side interface to interact with the server and retrieve news information.

## The Scripts

### Server Script (CreateServer.py)

The server script is responsible for handling client connections, fetching news data from NewsAPI.org, and responding to client requests.

Main functionalities:
- Handles client connections using sockets and threading.
- Retrieves news data from NewsAPI.org using the `requests` library.
- Parses client requests and sends appropriate responses back.

```python
# Insert relevant code snippets from CreateServer.py
```

### Client Script (Client.py)

The client script allows users to interact with the server and retrieve news information.

Main functionalities:
- Establishes connection with the server using sockets.
- Provides a menu-driven interface for users to search headlines, list sources, and quit.

```python
# Insert relevant code snippets from Client.py
```
